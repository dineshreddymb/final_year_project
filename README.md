This project on Suspicious human activity detection  
Suspicious Human Activity Detection on Surveillance Photos
üìå Project Overview
This project focuses on detecting suspicious human activities in surveillance photos using computer vision techniques and machine learning. The goal is to assist security teams by providing an automated way to flag potentially dangerous or abnormal behavior captured in surveillance footage.

üéØ Objectives
Detect human presence in surveillance images.

Classify whether the detected human activity is suspicious or normal.

Provide visual output with bounding boxes and labels.

Build a lightweight and scalable solution for real-world deployment.

üñºÔ∏è Sample Use Cases
Public spaces (stations, airports)

Corporate campuses

Residential buildings

Restricted areas

Automated security monitoring

‚öôÔ∏è Tech Stack
Programming Language: Python

Libraries:

OpenCV (image processing)

TensorFlow / PyTorch (deep learning models)

scikit-learn (ML pipeline)




NumPy, Pandas (data manipulation)

Model: Pre-trained object detection (YOLO / SSD / Faster R-CNN) + custom activity classifier

Deployment: Can be integrated with cloud or edge devices


How To Execute
************
Step 1: Go to : C drive or D drive (choose D drive if not C drive)
Step 2: create one new project folder in D drive or C drive
Step 3: Extract project source code zip file in your project folder(D drive or C drive)
             After extract the source code zip file rename the source code folder(you  should change the folder name into short name)
Step 4: open vs code 
             Select file tab: open folder choose your project folder
Step 5: open .py file
Step 6: check in your source code file is there ‚Äúrequirements.txt‚Äù available or not. 
             in the requirements.txt file we have available libraries names so should install that libraries for your project.
Step 7: open Terminal, new Terminal in vs code, check python - -version & mysql - -version
Step 8: open CMD check python - -version & mysql - -version
STEP 9: open poweshell with ‚ÄúRun as Administration‚Äù
              Give this command :ÔÉ† Get-ExecutionPolicy
              Give this command :ÔÉ† Set-ExecutionPolicy Unrestricted -Scope Process
Step 10: create a project path in powershell
                Command:ÔÉ†cd .. (using cd command come back to C drive or D drive)
               For Example
               Command: ÔÉ† C:\Users\USER3\DriverAttentiveness\Driver attentiveness
  Step 11: create a environment in powershell              
               Command: ÔÉ† python -m venv venv (after check ‚Äúvenv‚Äù folder create or not in your project folder)
Step 12: Activate your environment in powershell using below command(just minimize your powershell)
              Command :ÔÉ†  .\venv\Scripts\Activate
Step 13: ÔÉ† open vs code go to terminal here activate the environment
               Command :ÔÉ† .\venv\Scripts\Activate (if you get error in vs code please run the below command)
               Command :ÔÉ† Set-ExecutionPolicy -Scope Process -ExecutionPolicy Bypass (after this command give below command it will activate)
               Command :ÔÉ† .\venv\Scripts\Activate
Step 14: ÔÉ† install below libraries for python project
pip install matplotlib
pip install seaborn
pip install scikit-learn
pip install nltk
pip install tensorflow
pip install numpy
pip install pandas
step 15: ÔÉ†now run the project using below command
