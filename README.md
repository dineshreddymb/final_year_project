This project on Suspicious human activity detection  
Suspicious Human Activity Detection on Surveillance Photos
üìå Project Overview
This project focuses on detecting suspicious human activities in surveillance photos using computer vision techniques and machine learning. The goal is to assist security teams by providing an automated way to flag potentially dangerous or abnormal behavior captured in surveillance footage.

üéØ Objectives
Detect human presence in surveillance images.

Classify whether the detected human activity is suspicious or normal.

Provide visual output with bounding boxes and labels.

Build a lightweight and scalable solution for real-world deployment.

üñºÔ∏è Sample Use Cases
Public spaces (stations, airports)

Corporate campuses

Residential buildings

Restricted areas

Automated security monitoring

‚öôÔ∏è Tech Stack
Programming Language: Python

Libraries:

OpenCV (image processing)

TensorFlow / PyTorch (deep learning models)

scikit-learn (ML pipeline)

NumPy, Pandas (data manipulation)

Model: Pre-trained object detection (YOLO / SSD / Faster R-CNN) + custom activity classifier

Deployment: Can be integrated with cloud or edge devices
